h2. Beanstalk-upload script

I'm getting a lot of trouble trying to upload wars to Beanstalk using its console. Specially large wars (larger than 50MB).
So, I've build this simple script that upload your war to Beanstalk and generates one version for it.

h3. Usage

You have to have a _credentials.properties_ file in the same directory you're running the script. 
The default AWS 'credentials.properties' file as below

<pre>
accessKey = AKIAAIEQF6SPAKSE5BN5
secretKey = J7fa9akja879FGA308JAHA749jha7va83akaf931
</pre>

After that, just run the beanstalk.groovy with the usage shown below:

<pre>
Usage: groovy beanstalkUpload.groovy <path_to_war> <application_name> <application_version_label>
</pre>

Don't forget to add jars/* files into your classpath.

*Example*

<pre>
groovy beanstalkUpload.groovy ../sde-0.1.war sde
</pre>

h3. Output

Output will be thrown in your console, as this example:
